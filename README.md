Hello World, My name is [Daman (pronounced as duh-men)](https://www.howtopronounce.com/hindi/daman). I am a relationship-oriented, tech-savvy software professional with strong technical & analytical skills. I am passionate about writing code, and I am always looking for new opportunities that will help me learn better ways to develop. Working with others and discussing development terms are among my favorite pastimes. You may... 
  
- Give me data, and I can extract knowledge and insights for you.
- Tell me what you need, and I can design a solution.
- Give me a coding problem, and I can solve it efficiently.
  
Other than that...

- :speech_balloon:  I love talking about Go, Python, JavaScript, Java, Stock Market, Finance, DevOps, SDLC, Containers, Kubernetes, Open Source, Cloud, Data Analytics, Business Intelligence.
- :microphone:  My pronouns are [he/him][pronoun]

Basically, I'm a computer nerd that absolutely ‚ù§Ô∏è s ‚òï. Yes it's trite...but I'm owning it.
